## Challenge Information
In the 2025 NASA App Development Challenge (ADC), middle and high school teams had ten weeks to create a video showcasing their application accurately visualizing the environment and flight path of the Artemis II mission. Additional requirements included but were not limited to indicating which of SCaNâ€™s antennas are available for spacecraft-ground communication, prioritizing these antennas while optimizing various factors, and utilizing color in various places to convey certain pieces of information. High-scoring teams were invited to an interview consisting of ADC organizers and NASA SCaN team members, who inquired the teams on their development process, ADC experience, outreach events, and how the ADC could improve. From a combination of these two events, four Top Teams were selected for paid-for attendance of the Culminating Event held at Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX from April 14, 2025 to April 17, 2025. Top Teams had to recreate their video, submit a final presentation, provide quotes about their ADC experience, and provide photos of the team at work. At the Culminating Event, Top Teams toured exclusive and restricted buildings at Johnson Space Center, presented to a variety of audiences, networked with NASA personnel and fellow Top Teams, and much more. On the final day of the event, Top Teams delivered their Final Presentations and were awarded one superlative each. One Top Team, Team Hydrogen, was awarded the NASA ADC's highest distinction, the Innovation Award. Following this, all ADC students participated in a pinning ceremony, signifying their acceptance into the NASA community.
